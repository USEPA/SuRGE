There are some additional gga files in this folder of unknown origin.  
I have re-named them with an "s" in front of their original filename so 
that they are not currently being read into our R Script.

Re-labelled the second set of sites visited on the lake (after lunch) with an "f" 
to replace the first "g" in "gga".  Wrote script to assign a different wrong year 
these data so I can distinguish them when doing the clock adjustment.
