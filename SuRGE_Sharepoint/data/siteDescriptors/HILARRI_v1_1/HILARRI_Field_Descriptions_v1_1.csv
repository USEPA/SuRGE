grand_id,N/A,Integer,ID from GRanD
dam_name,N/A,Text,Dam name listed in dam inventory
longitude,Decimal Degrees,Numeric,Longitude listed by dam inventory or plant inventory if the power plant wasn't referenced to an inventoried dam. Some features' coordinates have been updated during QA process. See LOC_FLAG for source of updated location. (EPSG: 4269)
latitude,Decimal Degrees,Numeric,Latitude listed by dam inventory or plant inventory if the power plant wasn't referenced to an inventoried dam. Some features' coordinates have been updated during QA process. See LOC_FLAG for source of updated location. (EPSG: 4269)
loc_flag,N/A,Text,"Description of the source for which dataset was used to help update coordinates of a feature. Possible values include:

FERC Elib
GRanDv1.3
HydroLAKES
NHDPlusV2
NHDWB"
state,N/A,Text,US State abbreviation
eha_cmplx,N/A,Text,Root of the EHA ID. Describes the complex of power plants.
eha_ptid,N/A,Text,Plant ID used by the EHA (EHA_PtID)

pt_lat,Decimal Degrees,Numeric,Latitude reported by the EHA (Lat) (EPSG: 4269)
pt_lon,Decimal Degrees,Numeric,Longitude reported by the EHA (Lon) (EPSG: 4269)
eia_ptid,N/A,Text,EIA plant identification code reported by the EHA (EIA_PtID)
fcdocket,N/A,Text,FERC license docket number reported by the EHA (FcDocket)
ehadamflag,N/A,Text,Note to describe issues when linking the most recent EHA operational plant information to the most recent dam inventories. Describes: if a dam is listed multiple times in the inventory; if there are multiple power plants associated with a single dam; or if the project is composed of several related structures that are listed separately in the inventories.
statusflag,N/A,Text,Summarizes which datasets confirmed hydropower. A feature  listed only in the NID or GRanD but not the EHA may not accurately describe current operational capabilities.

1) Infrastructure matched to multiple waterbodies. 
2) Multiple infrastructure features matched to this waterbody.
3) Waterbody is not accurate."
hylakeflag,N/A,Text,"Flags indicating possible issues associated with matching the dam/plant and water body. 

Flags include:

huc_02,N/A,Text,2-digit identifier for NHD Watershed Boundary Dataset Hydrologic Unit (Region level). Note that all HUCs should be 2 digits. Those from Hydrologic Units 01 - 09 should include the leading zero.
dataset,N/A,Text,"Basic descriptor of the type of relationships represented in each record. Possible values include: 
1) Hydropower dam associated with power plant and reservoir
2) Hydropower dam associated with power plant; no reservoir
3) Hydropower dam associated with reservoir; no power plant
4) Hydropower dam only; no reservoir or power plant
5) Power plant associated with reservoir; no inventoried dam
6) Power plant only; no reservoir or inventoried dam"
