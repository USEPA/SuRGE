## SuRGE hydropower

Henriette Jager executed a spatial join between the SuRGE survey design and HydroSource generation data.  The resulting data were provided as an sf object stored as 'SuRGE.EHA.Rdata'.  Below we confirm file location:

```{r }
# double check the file location
# utilizing relative file paths
list.files("../../../../data/hydropower/")
```

Something weird happens if I assign the loaded object to a new name.  Just use the name that comes with the object (SuRGE.EHA.sf).
```{r}

# load data object
load("../../../../data/hydropower/SuRGE.EHA.Rdata") # data object is SuRGE.EHA.sf
str(SuRGE.EHA.sf)
class(SuRGE.EHA.sf)
SuRGE.EHA.sf
names(SuRGE.EHA.sf)
```
