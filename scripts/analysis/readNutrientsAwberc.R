# NUTRIENT ANALYSIS ON LACHAT CONDUCTED IN AWBERC

# Original data can be found at: L:\Priv\Cin\ORD\Pegasus-ESF\Lachat Data\Nutrients
# Copy of original 2021 data file at SP:

# see readChem.R in mulitResSurvey repo for an example of how to read data.

# Need to create a "nutrients_qual" column to indicate holding time violations.
# Value of "HOLD" if holding time violated, else blank.  Holding time should be
# calculated as difference between "analyte_detection_date" and "collection_date".
# use flag columns (i.e. srp_flag, no2_3_flag) to indicate censored values.  

# The lab quantified inorganics (no2, no2.3, oP (named RP in awberc data file),
# and nh4) in both filtered and unfiltered samples.  We only want inorganic data
# for filtered samples.  Filtered samples can be identified by the "D" proceeding
# the sample collection depth in the 'pos $char4.' column (e.g., D-Sh).

# The lab quantified total nutrients (tp and tn) for both filtered and unfiltered
# samples.  We only want tp and tn for unfiltered samples.  Unfiltered samples
# can be identified by the "T" proceeding the sample collection depth in the 
# 'pos $char4.' column (e.g., T-Sh).

# All analyte names begin with a "T" to indicate "total" (e.g. TNH4).  Ignore this
# and use the analyte names defined in github issue #10.
