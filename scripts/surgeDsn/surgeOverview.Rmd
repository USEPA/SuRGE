# Background
The USEPA Office of Air and Radiation has requested that methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs be included in the *Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks*.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued guidance for estimating these emissions, but the model used to derive the IPCC emission factors was trained with a global data set which included very few measurements from the US.  It is therefore uncertain how accurate the IPCC emission factors are for US reservoirs.  Methane emission rates vary by three orders of magnitude across US reservoirs and a small bias in IPCC emission factors could strongly bias the inventory estimate.
To address this problem, the Office of Research and Development will execute a three-year survey of CH4 and CO2 emission rates from US reservoirs.  This will be a collaborative effort involving several ORD locations, EPA Regional Biologists, and other collaborators.


# Survey Design

The SuRGE project (Survey of Reservoir Greenhouse gas Emissions) is a statistical survey of CH4 and CO2 emission rates from 108 U.S. reservoirs.  The survey design includes stratification by ecoregion, depth, and chlorophyll, thereby ensuring large gradients in environmental drivers (i.e. depth, chla) to inform subsequent modeling efforts.  Each waterbody was previously sampled by the US EPA during the [2017 National Lakes Assessment](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys).

# Measurement Details
Each of the 108 waterbodies in the survey will be sampled one time during the three year program (2020 - 2022). All sampling will be conducted between June 1 and Sept. 15.  Each waterbody will contain 15 - 25 sites where ebullitive (i.e. bubbling) emission rates will be measured via overnight deployments of inverted funnels.  Diffusive emissions will be measured at the sites via ~3 minute floating chamber deployments.  Ancillary measurements include water chemistry, chlorophyll, and dissolved gas concentrations.
