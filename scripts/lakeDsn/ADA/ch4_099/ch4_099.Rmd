## General Information
Large reservoir (24km2) in Arkansas.  Reservoir polygon was clipped along the 1m contour line, which excluded large portions of several inlets and bays.  Hopefully this will minimize the need for oversample sites.

Lake is divided into three sections to expedite the use of oversample sites, if needed.  Four extra sites added (19 total) to get better coverage across this large system.

## Index Site
NLA reports maximum depth of 8m, but bathymetry map shows 20m depth near the dam.   S16 will likely be the deepest site.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-099/099_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-099/099_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-099/ch4_099Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
