## General Information
7km2 Lake Cotile.  There is a bridge bisecting the southern portion of the lake, but it appears to be tall enough to navigate underneath it.  There is only one site south of the bridge.  I expect the water to be about 5 feet deep in that area.

The lake is split into two sections for efficiency if oversample sites are needed.  Be sure to use oversample sites in numeric order within each section.

The lake was drawn down by 8 feet last summer to eradicate nuisance aquatic vegetation.  It was scheduled to be raised up to full pool by early spring 2023.

## Index Site
Maximum depth is 28 feet near the dam.  I'm guessing sites 3 or 7 will be the Index Site.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-004/004_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-004/004_Over.png")
```

<P style="page-break-before: always">
## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-004/ch4_004Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
