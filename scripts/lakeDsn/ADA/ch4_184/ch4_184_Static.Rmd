## General Information
Small reservoir locally known as Rush Cr. Site 17 Reservoir.  This is one of many reservoirs in the Rush Cr. watershed.  We have very little information on this lake.  There doesn't appear to be a good boat ramp, so this is likely a drag in lake.


## Index Site
No bathymetry, but NLA reports a max depth of 3.6m.  Assume greatest depth will be at a site nearby the dam.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-184/184_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-184/184_Over.png")
```

<P style="page-break-before: always">
## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-184/ch4_184Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
