## General Information

Shawnee Mission Park, a multi-use, 1,600-acre park, is located at West 79th Street and Renner Road in Shawnee, Kansas. The land was purchased through the district's initial bond issue in 1956 and officially dedicated on May 30, 1964. It is the largest park in the county and the most visited park in the entire state of Kansas.

Shawnee Mission Park is home to a number of fantastic amenities as well as a beautiful 120-acre lake. Our beautiful scenic lake is a very popular spot for boating, fishing, sail boarding and much more.

The park also has 11 spacious shelters, numerous picnic areas, nature trails, play areas, an archery range, a 53-acre dog off-leash area and a disc golf course. It is a great place to enjoy mountain biking and horseback riding.

The park is also home to The Theatre in the Park, Shawnee Mission Park Beach and Shawnee Mission Park Marina. In season, there are canoes, pedal boats and fishing boats available for rent at the marina.
