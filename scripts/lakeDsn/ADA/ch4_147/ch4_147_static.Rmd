## Index Site
No bathymetry for lake.  Will assume deepest water is near dam.  U-12 is close to dam, but also very close to shoreline.  Use U-01 unless it becomes obvious that other sites are much deeper.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-147/147_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-147/147_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }
# this is failing.  Can't figure out why.
coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-147/ch4_147_sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")



knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
