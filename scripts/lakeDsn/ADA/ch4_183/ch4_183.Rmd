## General Information
Small waterbody (0.1km2) in Copper Breaks State Park.  Lake had insufficient water to sample in 2021.  Design is based on Landsat imagery from May 5, 2023.

According to state park website, "Bring your kayak, canoe or small fishing boat. Lake Copper Breaks has a small boat ramp. The 60-acre lake is a no-wake zone; jet skis are not allowed."  It looks like boating is possible under 'normal' water levels.

## Index Site
NLA reports maximum depth of 4m.  No bathymetry data available, but presumably deepest spot will be near dam.  

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-183/183_Main.png")

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/ADA/CH4-183/ch4_183Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
