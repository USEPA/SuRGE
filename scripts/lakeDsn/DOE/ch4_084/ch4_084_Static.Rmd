## General Information
Marrowbone Lake is located in Davidson County, on Marrowbone Lake Road near Joelton Tennessee, 15 miles north of Nashville.  The lake is 0.2 km^2^ and has a picnic area, concession area, restrooms.  Fishing facilities include a boat launching ramp, fishing pier, and a bait and tackle shop.

•	There are no bridges.  
•	The upper end of the lake is very shallow.  
•	As of now, we do not have any aquatic vegetation issues, but as we have seen in other areas that can change quickly due to the invasive problem.  
•	There will be no dredging.  
•	No drawdowns are planned, but that can always change if there is an unseen issue.  
•	Water levels are fairly stable.

## Index Site
Deepest water is near the dam.  Sites 15 and 3 should be ~10m deep.  Use whichever is deepest.
