## Summary
The SW end of lake is a Cypress swamp with unknown accessibility.  This region constitutes the 'cypress' stratum in the survey design and has two main sites and 5 oversample sites.  The open-water stratum has 15 main sites.  Ideally, we will sample the first 13 main sites in the open-water and the two in cypress.  If we are unable to access cypress sites, compensate by sampling additional main sites in open-water.  We should sample a total of 15 sites for the entire lake.

Use SU-08 for Index site.


## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-044/044_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-044/044_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-044/ch4-044Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
