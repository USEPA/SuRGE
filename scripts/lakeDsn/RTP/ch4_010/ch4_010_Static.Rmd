## General Information
Very strangely shaped reservoir.  Survey design excludes a north/south oriented channel on the east side of the lake.  The channel looks like it could be quite shallow.

Design includes 25 oversample sites, rather than the typical 20.  I would typically divide this reservoir into north and south sections to minimize travel time if oversample sites are needed, but I'm really uncertain about water depth on south side of reservoir.  If there is no deep water on south side, you can use oversample sites on north side.

We have very little information on water depth, but NLA reported a depth of 6m near site U-31.  This seems pretty deep given the areal imagery, but is encouraging.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-010/010_Over.png")

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-010/ch4_010Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
