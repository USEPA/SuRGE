## General Information
Tiny waterbody very close to coastline.  I expect high salinity and low CH4 production.

Landsat imagery shows stable water levels with persistent vegetation mat in middle of waterbody.  Water to east of vegetation appears to be very shallow and was eliminated from survey design.  No bathymetry data, but NLA reports a depth of 4.5m near site 8. 

## Index Site
No info on bathymetry, use deepest site.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-045/045_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-045/045_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/RTP/CH4-045/ch4_045Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
