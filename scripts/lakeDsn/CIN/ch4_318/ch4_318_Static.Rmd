## General Information
Per local manager "Water levels in Mahoney Reservoir will likely be much lower in July relative to June based on past experience with small reservoirs in the basin. Again it all depends on spring precipitation in the basin though sampling earlier than 7/13 is probably better if it works with your schedule."

Landsat shows dry reservoir in 2021, but some water present in spring of 2016 â€“ 2019.  Google Earth has images from spring 2014 and 2017.  Defined lake extent using Landsat image from July 2019.
