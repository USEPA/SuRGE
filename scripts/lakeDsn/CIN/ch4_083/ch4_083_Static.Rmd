## General Information
Very large (40km2) reservoir.  Probably best to treat as two waterbodies.  Probably do area west of bridge on days 1 and 2, followed by area east of bridge on days 2 and 3.

Nine boat ramps to choose from.  DeLormes Gazetteer may be best map for locating boat ramps. It is approximately 10 miles from Paynetown Marina to the dam.  The boat tops out at ~ 40mph, so this should be < 30 minutes.

Marinas at Fairfax, Paynetown, and Cutright Rec Areas have gas available during typical summers.

No good printable bathymetry map available.  Probably best to use map in depth finder.

## Index Site
Use U-06.  Should be approximately 30 feet deep.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-083/083_Main.png")
```

# Oversample sites

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-083/ch4_083_sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
