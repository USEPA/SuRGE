## General Information
Huge reservoir split into three separate lakes for SuRGE sampling.  This design is for the upstream riverine zone of the reservoir.  Riverine zone extends from river mile 940 to top of reservoir based on longitudinal profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the USACE final report for 2018.  Total surface area of 10.25 km2.  No bathymetry available, but final report suggests ~20' deep throughout this section.

This design is for a randomly chosen subset of the overall riverine zone.  The sampling section was chosen by randomly locating a dot in the riverine zone, then defining a polygon that extends equal distances up and downstream from the point.  Overall size of the polygon was chosen to allow the sampling to be conducted over two days. 

There are three boat ramps ~11km upriver near Oacoma and Chamberlin.  See FrancisCaseBoatRamps.pdf for details.
