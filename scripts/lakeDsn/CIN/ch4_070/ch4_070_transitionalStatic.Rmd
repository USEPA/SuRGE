## General Information
Huge reservoir split into three separate lakes for SuRGE sampling.  This design is for the transitional zone of Francis Case.   Transitional zone extends from river mile 920 to 940, based on longitudinal profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the USACE final report for 2018.  Total surface area of 19.25 km2.  No bathymetry available, but final report suggests ~60' deep throughout this section.

This design is for a randomly chosen subset of the overall transitional zone.  The sampling section was chosen by randomly locating a dot in the transitional zone, then defining a polygon that extends equal distances up and downstream from the point.  Overall size of the polygon was chosen to allow the sampling to be conducted over two days. 

The design includes 15 sampling points, all of which will require funnel deployments.  Assuming 15 minutes per site, we are looking at 4 hours of work.  Lets further assume one hour at index site.  If we were to go out and back in one boat, assume 2 hours of driving time.  Total time on water = 7 hours.
