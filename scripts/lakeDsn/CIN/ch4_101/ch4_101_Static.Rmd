## General Information
Drinking water reservoir for City of Jackson. This drinking water reservoir is typically electric only, but we have an exemption.  I wouldn't be surprised if you get questioned, so bring a hardcopy of the e-mail from City of Jackson with you.  Also, City of Jackson Drinking Water Treatment Plant operator requested that you text when you arrive and depart from the lake. Ron Aldrich at City of Jackson Water Treatment Plant 740-286-3010
