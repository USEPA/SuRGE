## General Information
Very small (0.2 km2) and remote reservoir.  Small campground at lake.  There doesn't appear to be a decent boat ramp, so this is probably a jon boat lake.

No bathymetry available, but NLA data report a depth of 4m at the south side of reservoir near the tributary inflow.  Presumably the reservoir is deeper near the dam.

## Index Site
One of the sites near the dam (whichever is deepest).  Probably 2, 3, or 6.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-276/276_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-276/276_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-276/ch4_276Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
