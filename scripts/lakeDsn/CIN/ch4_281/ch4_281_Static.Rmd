## General Information
There is a good chance Upper Twin Lake will be iced over in June, at least for the first several weeks. We're having a relatively cool spring and are actually adding to the snowpack as of late. I suspect the lake will stay froze over until late June or early July. Additionally, you may not be able to drive to the lake until the same time frame due to the added snowpack. A safer time to sample it would probably be mid-to-late July. The upper lake has relatively good access, but not as good as the lower lake. I believe there is a gate on the trail/road that leads to the upper lake. It's relatively short walk to get there, but if you need to be able to drive equipment to the shoreline, then you should probably contact the Bitterroot National Forest to inquire about access or any special use permits needed. Since you are not sampling fish or wildlife, there shouldn't be a need for any permits from MT FWP for this work. Let me know if you have any other questions.  â€“ Jason
