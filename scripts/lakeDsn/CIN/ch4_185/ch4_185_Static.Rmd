## General Information
The NHD polygon for this site encompasses two basins that are contigous during high water, but separated during lower water levels.  We expect the basins to be separated during SuRGE sampling.  We will focus on the east basin, known as Red Lake, and not sample the west basin (La Cueva).

## Index Site
Not much depth info here.  NLA reports 3.1m in eastern basin.
