## General Information
10km2 reservoir, max depth ~60 feet.  Located within Sherman Reservoir State Recreation Area.  Three boat ramps to choose from (see bathymetry map).  Survey design features a high density of sites below main trib input and a total of four sections to facilitate oversample usage.  This reservoir is used for irrigation and according to BLM (https://www.usbr.gov/gp/recreation/shnerec.html)  "Irrigation supply reservoir experiencing extreme fluctuations".  Be prepared for the possibility of oversample usage.  




## Index Site
Use SU-40.  Should be approximately 40 feet deep.
