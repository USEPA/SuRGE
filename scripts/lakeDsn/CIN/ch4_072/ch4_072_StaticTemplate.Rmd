## General Information
Katie Vivian, MT Fisheries Biologist, provided: Region 6 Biologist Cody Nagel 406-265-6177
Contacted USBR Toby Tabor.  Forwarded me to Jeff Buamberger, USBR.  

J. Buamberger said there was no need for USBR to permit us for Nelson or Willow Creek (both USBR).  He was very helpful and said we will probably not see anyone on either lake unless the fishing is particularly good.  These are very remote with little traffic, although a ramp and some limited parking are available.  These are drawn down for irrigation water but should still have sufficient water for sampling.  

Managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, P.O. Box 220, Chester, MT 59522; (406) 759-5077. Located near Saco, on Hwy. 2. This reservoir, with 4,320 surface acres and 30 miles of shoreline, offers good fishing for walleye, perch, and northern pike. Concrete boat ramp, campground, and picnic shelters.

This an 8km2 reservoir, so a relatively large one.  I split into two sections for sampling.  We do not have bathymetry for this one.

## Index Site
No bathymetry.  Please use deepest site; presumably near dam.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-072 OS/072_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-072 OS/072_Over.png")

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-072 OS/ch4_072Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
