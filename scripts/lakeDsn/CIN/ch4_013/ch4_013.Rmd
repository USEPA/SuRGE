## General Information
Small Pond (km2)

## Index Site
NLA reports maximum depth of 1.2m.  Bathymetry map shows 2m near dam.  Site U-01, located near the dam, is likely to be the deepest.

Sounds like a pretty place.  I found this review online:
Concord pond has been a favorite of ours for the past year. I am an amateur family kayaker. I stumbled on the ponds beautiful back tributaries of fresh cool water and have been hooked every since.

This was our fitfth trip and the waters were higher than usual with a pretty strong current. Ever season I've been there is something new to see. Abundant wild life, moss, fungus and beautiful trees. We packed a lunch and bass fished slowly toward the back.

If you enter the pond from the cement boat ramp left and hug the left bank a bit you'll soon be in 25 foot wide tributary. It's an easy beautiful paddle back.

In the shallowest of water my son caught good sized bass and pickerel. I saw an eagle fly over clutching a bass and multiple juvenile copper head, turtles everywhere and a round a bend a newborn dawn sleeping in some ferns by the banks.

The water is cool and clear. Last time in fall a red fox ran along the bank next to my boat.
