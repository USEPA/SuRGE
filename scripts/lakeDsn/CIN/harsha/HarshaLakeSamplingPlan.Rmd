subtitle: "Harsh Lake Sampling Plan"  
---

## General Information
Harsha Lake has a surface area of approximately 8 km^2^.  We are using an unstratified equal-probability survey design with 15 main sites and 20 oversample sites.  Be cautious when navigating to site U-06.  The main channel hugs the western bank.  There are lots of submerged stumps on the east bank that pose a navigation hazard.  Use the boat's navigation system to stay in the main channel.

Much of the southeastern section of the lake is a no wake zone.  Be on the lookout for submerged stumps and navigate with caution.



## Main Sites
