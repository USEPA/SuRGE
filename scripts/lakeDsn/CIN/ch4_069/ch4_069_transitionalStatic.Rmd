## General Information
Huge reservoir split into three separate lakes for SuRGE sampling.  This design is for the transitional zone of the reservoir.  The transitional zone extends from just below Mobridge to Beaver Cr.  Water depths range from 30' to 60' in this section.  Data from Duluth's survey showed no thermal stratification above Mobridge.

This design is for a randomly chosen subset of the overall transitional zone.  The sampling section was chosen by randomly locating a dot in the transitional zone, then defining a polygon that extends equal distances up and downstream from the point.  Overall size of the polygon was chosen to allow the sampling to be conducted over two days. 

The transitional sampling section is approximately 10 km long and about 3km wide in most areas.  Total area is 23.7 km^2^.  Assume Joel's big boat can travel 60 km hr^-1^ (40 mph), we could theoretically traverse the entire length of the reservoir in <30 minutes.  For reference, the long tributary section of Cave Run was 20 km one way.  Adam navigated it one way in one long day.

The design includes 15 sampling points, all of which will require funnel deployments.  Assuming 15 minutes per site, we are looking at 4 hours of work.  Lets further assume one hour at index site.  If we were to go out and back in one boat, assume 2 hours of driving time.  Total time on water = 7 hours.

## Index Site
U-12, approximately 100' deep.
