## General Information
Huge reservoir split into three separate lakes for SuRGE sampling.  This design is for the upstream riverine zone of the reservoir.  The riverine zone extends from Beaver Bay to about 25 km south of Bismarck.  Water depths range from <10' to 30'. Data from Duluth's survey showed no thermal stratification in this area.

This design is for a randomly chosen subset of the overall riverine zone.  The sampling section was chosen by randomly locating a dot in the riverine zone, then defining a polygon that extends equal distances up and downstream from the point.  Overall size of the polygon was chosen to allow the sampling to be conducted over two days. 

The riverine sampling section is approximately 2.8 km long and about 3.4km wide in most areas.  Total area is 4.6 km^2^.  

The west shore of the river is part of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.  Do not attempt to access river from this shoreline.  There is a public boat ramp ~11 km downstream from sampling area at Beaver Cr.  This appears to be closest ramp.

See Jake for hardcopy bathymetry map.

## Index Site
The middle of the river appears to be the deepest location, approximately 20'.  Try site Sites 07, 09, or 12 will probably be deepest.
