## General Information
Relatively small (2.5km2) reservoir in Wisconsin.  Max depth of 35 feet near the dam.  There are three public ramps.  At least one of them requires an $8 launch fee, BRING CASH.  Note several no-wake areas indicated in web map with yellow diamonds.  Expect to see buoys in lake confirming no wake areas.

This lake is intensively to prevent invasive species introduction.  Boat, trailer, and equipment must be cleaned prior to launching boat.  See QAAP for details.

Sampling area below main trib input at a higher density than balance of reservoir.  No other strata or unequal probability sections in lake design.

## Index Site
S-17 or S-18 will likely be the deepest sites.  Expect depths of 20-30 feet.

## Main Sites
