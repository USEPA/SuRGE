## General Information
Heron Lake in New Mexico.  Typically a fairly large reservoir, but currently at 10% capacity with a surface area of ~4km2.  Using an unequal probability design to ensure sampling sites near two largest tributary inputs.
Lake is in a state park with boat dock and marina.  Willow Creek ramp is the only one available for launching in extreme low water (poor boating) conditions. Concrete ramp faces north.  It has two turnarounds, one low and one high. Angle parking for staging at top.
Nearby Stonehouse Lodge has lodging options.

## Index Site
No bathymetry, but assume deepest water near dam.  Probably site U-01.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-247/247_Main.png")

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-247/ch4_247Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
