## General Information
Tiny reservoir (<0.1km2) located within city park.  Not much of a boat ramp available, and typically electric only.  Judy Holland (304-675-1068) set up all permissions for us.  Contact her at park office when you arrive to get directions for launching boat.



## Index Site
No bathymetry data.  I suspect this lake is very shallow.  Please use deepest site as Index.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-116/116_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-116/116_Over.png")
```

<P style="page-break-before: always">
## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-116/ch4_116_sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
