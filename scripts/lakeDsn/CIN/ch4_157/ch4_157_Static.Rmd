## General Information
Reservoir has a surface area of 4.5 km^2^ at full pool, but recent drought has brought the reservoir down to 1.5 km^2^.  The boat launch is closed and motorized boats are not allowed on the lake.  Scott Jacobs spoke with park manager and confirmed that we can sample, but will need to shore launch the jon boat.

## Index Site
Park website reports a maximum depth of 50 feet.  It is likely considerably less with lower water levels in 2022. NLA reported a depth of 7m at site U-05.  Presumably deeper water exists closer to the dam (sites 14 and 4).
