## General Information
Our local contacts are Katie Vivian (Montana State Biologist, KVivian@mt.gov) and Jeff Buamberger (jbaumberger@usbr.gov, (406) 247-7314).

Design assumes a lake area of 2.5 km2.

This is a relatively remote and lightly used reservoir.  Unlikely that we will see anybody out there.  There is a boat ramp, dock, and parking available.  Reservoir is used for irrigation and is drawn down throughout the summer.  The survey design assumes the lake will be at ~50% capacity based on input from local managers.  I have no bathymetry data and therefore don't know where you are most likely to need oversample sites.  I'm using an unstratified design which might cause longer trips if oversample sites are needed, but also means oversample sites are available throughout the lake.

No good printable bathymetry map available.  Probably best to use map in depth finder.

## Index Site
I assume water will be deepest near the dam (site U-06), but hard to say without bathymetry data.  Please use deepest site.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-071/071_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-071/071_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-071/ch4_071Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
