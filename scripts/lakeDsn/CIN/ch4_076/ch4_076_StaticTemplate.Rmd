## General Information
“Eureka Res. and Willow Creek are managed by two different irrigation districts/companies.  Montana FWP owns/leases a public access location (Fishing Access Site) at each reservoir but we do not manage the reservoirs or their elevations” K. Vivian, MT Fisheries Biologist."

Reservoir is being rapidly drawn down for downstream irrigation needs.  Lake perimeter is based on historic satellite imagery of drought conditions.  Not sure if boat ramp will still be usable.

## Index Site
Given the historically low water levels, not sure where the deepest site will be located.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-076/076_Main.png")
```
<P style="page-break-before: always">
  
  

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-076/076_Over.png")
```

<P style="page-break-before: always">
## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/CIN/CH4-076/ch4_076Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
