## General Information
Small reservoir (~1km^2^).  No bathymetry data, but NLA indicates a max depth of 1.5m.  This seems too shallow, however, as the lake has a many docks and a well developed boat launch.  Water levels appear to get pretty dicey in the extreme NE side of lake, however, and we edited out some the NHD lake polygon that covered this area.  Furthermore, I split the remaining NE section into an independent section.  Do the best you can to get two sites in this area.  If too shallow, you can omit them.

## Index Site
No bathymetry.  Presumably deepest close to dam, so probably site U-06.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-316/316_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-316/316_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-316/ch4_316Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
