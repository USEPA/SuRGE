## General Information
Comins Lake is approximately 0.8 km^2^ with a maximum depth of 2.7 meters.  A review of 5 historical images of the lake on Google Earth indicated that water levels can vary substantially.  The design shown below is for the minimum water level likely to be encountered in July.  

## Index Site
We have no bathymetry for this lake.  Please use deepest sampling site as 'Index Site'.  This will likely be on the north side of lake.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-326/326_MainLow.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-326/326_OverLow.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-326/ch4_326SitesLow.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
