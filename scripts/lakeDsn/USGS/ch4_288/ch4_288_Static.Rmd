## General Information
5 km2 reservoir.  Landsat and Google Earth imagery indicates quite stable water levels across seasons and years.  No bathymetry information, so your somewhat flying blind on this one.

Broke the reservoir into 3 sections to facilitate the efficient use of oversample sites if needed.

## Index Site
No bathymetry, so not sure.  Presumably the sites closest to dam are deepest, so perhaps U-08 or U-14.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-288/288_Main.png")
```

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-288/288_Over.png")
```

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-288/ch4_288Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
```
