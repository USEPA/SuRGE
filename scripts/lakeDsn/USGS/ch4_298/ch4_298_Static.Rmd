## General Information
 Design for CH4-298, Wild Horse Reservoir.
 Polygon based on six historic images from Google Earth reflecting a fairly broad 
 range of reservoir heights.  We reviewed these with the local reservoir manager.  
 Based on current water levels, current snow pack in the mountains, and anticipated 
 irrigation demand, he felt that the ch4_298_Oct2006.jpg image is a good approximation 
 of the conditions we will encounter this summer.  This is supported by April 17, 2021
 Landsat imagery.  At that water level we will 
 be able to navigate our boat under the bridge leading to the middle arm.  
 The other two arms of the reservoir will remain unaccessible.

## Index Site
No bathymetry.  Site U-01 is closest to dam.

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/USGS/CH4-298/ch4_298Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
