## General Information
Upper and Lower Small reservoirs are separated by a small dam.  SuRGE sampling will be performed on the Upper reservoir located above (south) the dam.  Lower Slatersville Reservoir is about 0.5km2 and has been divided into two sections to facilitate oversampling, if needed.



## Index Site
There is a deep spot just north of the narrow section separating the northern and southern basins of the reservoir.  Similar depths can be found immediately above the dam.  Index site will likely be S-01, S-06 or S-04.  Use whichever is deepest.

## Main Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/NAR/CH4-057/057_Main.png")

## Oversample Sites
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Oversample sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/NAR/CH4-057/057_Over.png")

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/NAR/CH4-057/ch4_057Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
