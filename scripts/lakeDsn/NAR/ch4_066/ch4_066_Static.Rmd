## General Information
This 589 acre impoundment of the Rumford River has an average depth of 5
feet and a maximum depth of 11 feet. The bottom is hard sand throughout
except for the deep area, which is mud. The water is extremely fertile with
transparency at less than a foot during certain times of the year. Aquatic
vegetation is scant expect for emergent vegetation along the shoreline.

**Access**
Boat access to the pond is provided by a sand ramp which is managed by the
town of Norton. The ramp has parking for half a dozen vehicles and trailers
and is located off Lazy Lane on the eastern shore of the pond (71°11'43.72"W
41°59'22.99"N). Cartop and shorefishing access is also available on the
southern end of the pond off of Route 140 across from Freeman Street.
Please contact the town of Norton for additional information and/or
restrictions pertaining to public access of Norton Reservoir. 

## Index Site
The lake is fairly shallow.  The maximum depth of 11 feet is in a small hole in front of dam (see Norton Reservoir.pdf for bathymetry).  There are a few sites in 6-9 feet of water (sites 6, 14, and 9) that could serve as the Index site.
