## General Information
Approximately 1 km^2^ lake with several islands.  Maximum depth of 34 feet.

Using a stratified design to ensure sampling sites near the river inflow.

Several deep holes is southern half of lake.  We will probably use U-02 or U-09 as the Index site, whichever is deeper.

# Main sites
knitr::include_graphics( "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/NAR/CH4-051/051_Main.png")

## Site Coordinates
```{r, echo=FALSE, }

coords <- read.table(file = "../../../../../../../lakeDsn/NAR/CH4-051/ch4_051Sites.txt",
                      header = TRUE, sep = "\t")


knitr::kable(coords, caption = "Site coordinates")
