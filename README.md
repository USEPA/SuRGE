# Survey of Reservoir Greenhouse gas Emissions (SuRGE)

This project uses the `renv` library to manage library versions.  After creating a local clone, a message will appear in the console directing users to sync the project library  by running `renv::restore()`.  This will download the packages and versions used in this project as specified in the renv.lock file.  If you need to add libraries to the project, be sure to use `renv::snapshot` to update the lock file.  When collaborators sync their local clone with the master, they can then run `renv::restore()` to have the new library installed on their local project directory.  Please see here (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for a primer on `renv` and here (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html) for using `renv` in a collaborative workflow.

Please use caution when updating libraries already captured in the lock file.  The code runs succesfully with the suite of packages captured in the current lock file; updating package versions could cause problems with the existing code.  The whole point of `renv` is to  minimize the potential for code breakage due to differences among package versions.

The R project was initiated by J Beaulieu using R.3.6.2 and `renv` will produce a warning message if a different version of R is used.  In theory, `renv` shouldn't be sensitive to the version of R, but in practice I have found that `renv::restore()` can take a very long time or even fail if a different version of R is used.  I suggest using R.3.6.2, but you can try other versions.  

Please note that the .Rprofile file is under version control in the repository.  This file contains an autoloader which automatically downloads and installs the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library.  It is best that users do not use the .Rprofile file to further customize the environment. 

This project uses `conflicted` to manage conflicts between different packages.  For example, the conflict between `MASS::select()` and `dplyr::select()` can cause headaches.  This project uses `conflicted` functions to set the environment such that `select()` will always call `dplry::select()`.  `select()` from the `MASS` package can always be called as `MASS::select()`.
